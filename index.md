I am a 4th year PhD student in the Finance department of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. 

<br />
Before moving to sunny California, I spent a year working as Research Professional for Prof. Amir Sufi at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I earned a Master's in Finance and Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science and two undergraduate degrees in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Mannheim.<br />


When I am not thinking about how Financial Markets interact with the outside world you can most likely find me running around Stanford's campus or with my teammates at Peninsula Distance Club under the supervision of Dena Evans.
