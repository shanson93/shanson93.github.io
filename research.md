<b>Institutional investors in the market for single-family housing: Where did they come from, where did they go?</b><br>
This paper analyzes the entry of institutional investors into the single family rental market in the aftermath of the Great Recession. I show that their entry is an equilibrium response to increased expected excess returns, driven by tightened household funding constraints through an increase in mortgage lending standards and declining real interest rates. Neighborhoods that institutional investors enter experience significant declines in housing affordability and home-ownership rates. A stylized model of a local housing market with funding constrained households and an unconstrained outside investor generates predictions consistent with my empirical evidence.<br>
